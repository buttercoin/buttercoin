Buttercoin
==========
### An Open Source Bitcoin Exchange

Copyright &copy; 2013 Buttercoin Developers

What is Buttercoin?
-------------------

Following the events of April 2013 in which Bitcoin value dropped dramatically as a result of the short comings of existing exchanges it was decided that there should be a community driven and open source exchange. As such Buttercoin was born out of neccesity for this. Buttercoin allows the decentralisation of exchange between Bitcoin and other currencies.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, and submit pull requests when their features or 
bug fixes are ready.

The patch will be accepted if the content is broad consensus. Developers are expected 
to rework and resubmit patches if the code does not match the project's coding conventions 
or it is controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

This is an open project and all are encouraged to contribute.

Testing
-------

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `test/`.
