### An Open Source Bitcoin Exchange

What is Buttercoin?
-------------------

Following the events of April 2013 in which Bitcoin value dropped dramatically as a result of the short comings of existing exchanges it was decided that there should be a community driven and open source exchange. As such Buttercoin was born out of neccesity for this. Buttercoin allows the decentralisation of exchange between Bitcoin and other currencies.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they are **sure**
their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

This is an open project and all are encouraged to contribute.

Testing
-------

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `test/`.
